                </a>
                <p>KEA prides itself on it’s global outlook and after passing the first year exam, students can choose to go abroad for their 3rd semester or the entire programme at one one our partner institutions in Europe or further afield. The equivalent study programmes are assessed according to the grading system at the institution where the exam is held. We are established as an international educational institution with many exchanges both to and from KEA by both students and teachers. This gives you a wealth of international contacts that are crucial in a globalised marketplace. For more information and a look at KEA students’ experiences abroad, take a look at our Instagram @keaglobal.</p>

                </a>
                <p>At KEA our approach to learning is that students should not only know but be able to. Because of this practical approach, students spend ten weeks during the fourth semEster undertaking a semester either in a Danish company or abroad. During their internship they have the chance to use the skills they learned in a professional environment and working on real projects which are evaluated at the end of the internship. During your studies you are in close contact with businesses when creating projects and writing papers in cooperation with a specific company or organisation. We cooperate with a wide range of business types including agencies, companies, and cultural organisations. The internship is completed with an internal internship exam. The final project is a digital product and documentation report that is evaluated externally.
